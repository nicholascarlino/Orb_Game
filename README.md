Welcome to The Orb! 

Story:
Our story starts with a terrible shipwreck on an uninhabited island. Sadly, of course, you were the only one to make it alive off of the boat. You begin your journey by supplying yourself with necessities such as food, water, and shelter. You've replenished yourself, but come nightfall...a terrible threat awaits. 

Monsters begin to appear, eager to tear you apart, but you fight back with various projectiles. As you head deeper and deeper into the forest on the island, its clear that all the creatures are controlled by an evil glowing orb that you must defeat in order to stop this chaos. Who will prevail?
